main.py holds the main method for running the app.
run entertainment_installer.py to install the database and fill 
the default values

you must create the database before running the installer, and
you also must delete and recreate it before each run of the installer.

could not figure out implementation for connecting app to database, 
so for now they are both work, but there is no functionality connecting them. 

App should be in working order, human performance testing found 
several bugs, and all were resolved. Still some bugs in databases.
